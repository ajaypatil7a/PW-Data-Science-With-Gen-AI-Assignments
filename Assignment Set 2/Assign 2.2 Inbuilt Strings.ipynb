    "The len() function in Python is used to determine the length or the number of items in a collection. Its purpose is to return the number of elements in an object, such as a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) or a mapping (e.g., dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "When used with strings specifically, the len() function returns the number of characters in the string. Each character, including spaces and punctuation, is counted as a separate element.\n",

    "- With the str.join() method, the strings \"Hello\" and \"World\" from the list words are joined together with \", \" as the separator to form the string \"Hello, World\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods achieve string concatenation, but the choice between them depends on the specific requirements and preferences of your code. Generally, using the + operator is more concise for concatenating a small number of strings, while str.join() is more efficient for concatenating a large number of strings or when joining elements from an iterable."
